The aim is to ensure that all contributions are of high quality, align with the project\\'s goals, and are consistent with our coding standards.\\n\\n#### Purpose of Code Reviews\\n\\n[Permalink: Purpose of Code Reviews](#purpose-of-code-reviews)\\n\\n- Maintain Code Quality: Ensure that the codebase remains clean, readable, and maintainable.\\n- Knowledge Sharing: Facilitate knowledge sharing among contributors and help new contributors learn best practices.\\n- Bug Prevention: Catch potential bugs and issues before they are merged into the main branch.\\n- Consistency: Ensure consistency in style, design patterns, and architecture across the project.\\n\\n#### Review Process Overview\\n\\n[Permalink: Review Process Overview](#review-process-overview)\\n\\n- Reviewers should check the code for functionality, readability, consistency, and compliance with the project‚Äôs coding standards.\\n- If changes are necessary, the reviewer should leave constructive feedback.\\n- The contributor addresses feedback and updates the PR.\\n- The reviewer re-reviews the updated code.\\n- Once the code is approved by at least two reviewer, it can be merged into the main branch.\\n- Merging should be done by a maintainer or an authorized contributor.\\n\\n#### Code Review Checklist\\n\\n[Permalink: Code Review Checklist](#code-review-checklist)\\n\\n- Functionality\\n  - Correctness: Does the code perform the intended task? Are edge cases handled?\\n  - Testing: Is there sufficient test coverage? Do all tests pass?\\n  - Security: Are there any security vulnerabilities introduced by the change?\\n  - Performance: Does the code introduce any performance regressions?\\n- Code Quality\\n  - Readability: Is the code easy to read and understand? Is it well-commented where necessary?\\n  - Maintainability: Is the code structured in a way that makes future changes easy?\\n  - Style: Does the code follow the project‚Äôs style guidelines?\\n    Currently we use Ruff for format check and take Google Python Style Guide as reference.\\n  - Documentation: Are public methods, classes, and any complex logic well-documented?\\n- Design\\n  - Consistency: Does the code follow established design patterns and project architecture?\\n  - Modularity: Are the changes modular and self-contained? Does the code avoid unnecessary duplication?\\n  - Dependencies: Are dependencies minimized and used appropriately?\\n\\n#### Reviewer Responsibilities\\n\\n[Permalink: Reviewer Responsibilities](#reviewer-responsibilities)\\n\\n- Timely Reviews: Reviewers should strive to review PRs promptly to keep the project moving.\\n- Constructive Feedback: Provide feedback that is clear, constructive, and aimed at helping the contributor improve.\\n- Collaboration: Work with the contributor to address any issues and ensure the final code meets the project‚Äôs standards.\\n- Approvals: Only approve code that you are confident meets all the necessary criteria.\\n\\n#### Common Pitfalls\\n\\n[Permalink: Common Pitfalls](#common-pitfalls)\\n\\n- Large PRs: Avoid submitting PRs that are too large. Break down your changes into smaller, manageable PRs if possible.\\n- Ignoring Feedback: Address all feedback provided by reviewers, even if you don‚Äôt agree with it‚Äîdiscuss it instead of ignoring it.\\n- Rushed Reviews: Avoid rushing through reviews. Taking the time to thoroughly review code is critical to maintaining quality.\\n\\nCode reviews are an essential part of maintaining the quality and integrity of our open source project. By following these guidelines, we can ensure that CAMEL remains robust, secure, and easy to maintain, while also fostering a collaborative and welcoming community.\\n\\n### Guideline for Writing Docstrings\\n\\n[Permalink: Guideline for Writing Docstrings](#guideline-for-writing-docstrings)\\n\\nThis guideline will help you write clear, concise, and structured docstrings for contributing to `CAMEL`.\\n\\n#### 1\\\\. Use the Triple-Quoted String with `r\"\"\"` (Raw String)\\n\\n[Permalink: 1. Use the Triple-Quoted String with r\"\"\" (Raw String)](#1-use-the-triple-quoted-string-with-r-raw-string)\\n\\nBegin the docstring with `r\"\"\"` to indicate a raw docstring. This prevents any issues with special characters and ensures consistent formatting, especially in documentation tools like Sphinx.\\n\\n#### 2\\\\. Provide a Brief Class or Method Description\\n\\n[Permalink: 2. Provide a Brief Class or Method Description](#2-provide-a-brief-class-or-method-description)\\n\\n- Start with a concise summary of the purpose and functionality.\\n- Keep each line under `79` characters.\\n- The summary should start on the first line without a linebreak.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\nr\"\"\"Class for managing conversations of CAMEL Chat Agents.\\n\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n#### 3\\\\. Document Parameters in the Args Section\\n\\n[Permalink: 3. Document Parameters in the Args Section](#3-document-parameters-in-the-args-section)\\n\\n- Use an `Args`: section for documenting constructor or function parameters.\\n- Maintain the `79`-character limit for each line, and indent continuation lines by 4 spaces.\\n- Follow this structure:\\n  - Parameter Name: Match the function signature.\\n  - Type: Include the type (e.g., `int`, `str`, custom types like `BaseModelBackend`).\\n  - Description: Provide a brief explanation of the parameter\\'s role.\\n  - Default Value: Use ( `default: :obj:<default_value>`) to indicate default values.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\nArgs:\\n    system_message (BaseMessage): The system message for initializing\\n        the agent\\'s conversation context.\\n    model (BaseModelBackend, optional): The model backend to use for\\n        response generation. Defaults to :obj:`OpenAIModel` with\\n        `GPT_4O_MINI`. (default: :obj:`OpenAIModel` with `GPT_4O_MINI`)\\n```\\n\\n### Principles üõ°Ô∏è\\n\\n[Permalink: Principles üõ°Ô∏è](#principles-Ô∏è)\\n\\n#### Naming Principle: Avoid Abbreviations in Naming\\n\\n[Permalink: Naming Principle: Avoid Abbreviations in Naming](#naming-principle-avoid-abbreviations-in-naming)\\n\\n- Abbreviations can lead to ambiguity, especially since variable names and code in CAMEL are directly used by agents.\\n- Use clear, descriptive names that convey meaning without requiring additional explanation. This improves both human readability and the agent\\'s ability to interpret the code.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- Bad: msg\\\\_win\\\\_sz\\n- Good: message\\\\_window\\\\_size\\n\\nBy adhering to this principle, we ensure that CAMEL remains accessible and unambiguous for both developers and AI agents.\\n\\n#### Logging Principle: Use `logger` Instead of `print`\\n\\n[Permalink: Logging Principle: Use logger Instead of print](#logging-principle-use-logger-instead-of-print)\\n\\nAvoid using `print` for output. Use Python\\'s `logging` module ( `logger`) to ensure consistent, configurable, and professional logging.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- Bad:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nprint(\"Process started\")\\nprint(f\"User input: {user_input}\")\\n```\\n\\n- Good:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nArgs:\\nlogger.info(\"Process started\")\\nlogger.debug(f\"User input: {user_input}\")\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Board Item Create Workflow üõ†Ô∏è\\n\\n[Permalink: Board Item Create Workflow üõ†Ô∏è](#board-item-create-workflow-Ô∏è)\\n\\nAt CAMEL, we manage our project through a structured workflow that ensures efficiency and clarity in our development process. Our workflow includes stages for issue creation and pull requests (PRs), sprint planning, and reviews.\\n\\n#### Issue Item Stage:\\n\\n[Permalink: Issue Item Stage:](#issue-item-stage)\\n\\nOur [issues](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/issues) page on GitHub is regularly updated with bugs, improvements, and feature requests. We have a handy set of labels to help you sort through and find issues that interest you. Feel free to use these labels to keep things organized.\\n\\nWhen you start working on an issue, please assign it to yourself so that others know it\\'s being taken care of.\\n\\nWhen creating a new issue, it\\'s best to keep it focused on a specific bug, improvement, or feature. If two issues are related or blocking each other, it\\'s better to link them instead of merging them into one.\\n\\nWe do our best to keep these issues up to date, but considering the fast-paced nature of this field, some may become outdated. If you come across any such issues, please give us a heads-up so we can address them promptly. üëÄ\\n\\nHere‚Äôs how to engage with our issues effectively:\\n\\n- Go to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/issues), create a new issue, choose the category, and fill in the required information.\\n- Ensure the issue has a proper title and update the Assignees, Labels, Projects (select Backlog status), Development, and Milestones.\\n- Discuss the issue during team meetings, then move it to the Analysis Done column.\\n- At the beginning of each sprint, share the analyzed issue and move it to the Sprint Planned column if you are going to work on this issue in the sprint.\\n\\n#### Pull Request Item Stage:\\n\\n[Permalink: Pull Request Item Stage:](#pull-request-item-stage)\\n\\n- Go to [GitHub Pulls](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/pulls), create a new PR, choose the branch, and fill in the information, linking the related issue.\\n- Ensure the PR has a proper title and update the Reviewers (convert to draft), Assignees, Labels, Projects (select Developing status), Development, and Milestones.\\n- If the PR is related to a roadmap, link the roadmap to the PR.\\n- Move the PR item through the stages: Developing, Stuck, Reviewing (click ready for review), Merged. The linked issue will close automatically when the PR is merged.\\n\\n**Labeling PRs:**\\n\\n- **feat**: For new features (e.g., `feat: Add new AI model`)\\n- **fix**: For bug fixes (e.g., `fix: Resolve memory leak issue`)\\n- **docs**: For documentation updates (e.g., `docs: Update contribution guidelines`)\\n- **style**: For code style changes (e.g., `style: Refactor code formatting`)\\n- **refactor**: For code refactoring (e.g., `refactor: Optimize data processing`)\\n- **test**: For adding or updating tests (e.g., `test: Add unit tests for new feature`)\\n- **chore**: For maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore: Update dependencies`)\\n\\n### Sprint Planning & Review üéØ\\n\\n[Permalink: Sprint Planning & Review üéØ](#sprint-planning--review-)\\n\\n#### Definition\\n\\n[Permalink: Definition](#definition)\\n\\nSprint planning defines what can be delivered in the sprint and how it will be achieved. Sprint review allows stakeholders to review and provide feedback on recent work.\\n\\n#### Practice\\n\\n[Permalink: Practice](#practice)\\n\\n- **Sprint Duration**: Two weeks for development, one week for review.\\n- **Sprint Planning & Review**: Conducted biweekly during the dev meeting (around 30 minutes).\\n- **Planning**: Founder highlights the sprint goal and key points; developers pick items for the sprint.\\n- **Review**: Feedback on delivered features and identification of improvement areas.\\n\\n### Getting Help üÜò\\n\\n[Permalink: Getting Help üÜò](#getting-help-)\\n\\nOur aim is to make the developer setup as straightforward as possible. If you encounter any challenges during the setup process, don\\'t hesitate to reach out to a maintainer.

The aim is to ensure that all contributions are of high quality, align with the project\\'s goals, and are consistent with our coding standards.\\n\\n#### Purpose of Code Reviews\\n\\n[Permalink: Purpose of Code Reviews](#purpose-of-code-reviews)\\n\\n- Maintain Code Quality: Ensure that the codebase remains clean, readable, and maintainable.\\n- Knowledge Sharing: Facilitate knowledge sharing among contributors and help new contributors learn best practices.\\n- Bug Prevention: Catch potential bugs and issues before they are merged into the main branch.\\n- Consistency: Ensure consistency in style, design patterns, and architecture across the project.\\n\\n#### Review Process Overview\\n\\n[Permalink: Review Process Overview](#review-process-overview)\\n\\n- Reviewers should check the code for functionality, readability, consistency, and compliance with the project‚Äôs coding standards.\\n- If changes are necessary, the reviewer should leave constructive feedback.\\n- The contributor addresses feedback and updates the PR.\\n- The reviewer re-reviews the updated code.\\n- Once the code is approved by at least two reviewer, it can be merged into the main branch.\\n- Merging should be done by a maintainer or an authorized contributor.\\n\\n#### Code Review Checklist\\n\\n[Permalink: Code Review Checklist](#code-review-checklist)\\n\\n- Functionality\\n  - Correctness: Does the code perform the intended task? Are edge cases handled?\\n  - Testing: Is there sufficient test coverage? Do all tests pass?\\n  - Security: Are there any security vulnerabilities introduced by the change?\\n  - Performance: Does the code introduce any performance regressions?\\n- Code Quality\\n  - Readability: Is the code easy to read and understand? Is it well-commented where necessary?\\n  - Maintainability: Is the code structured in a way that makes future changes easy?\\n  - Style: Does the code follow the project‚Äôs style guidelines?\\n    Currently we use Ruff for format check and take Google Python Style Guide as reference.\\n  - Documentation: Are public methods, classes, and any complex logic well-documented?\\n- Design\\n  - Consistency: Does the code follow established design patterns and project architecture?\\n  - Modularity: Are the changes modular and self-contained? Does the code avoid unnecessary duplication?\\n  - Dependencies: Are dependencies minimized and used appropriately?\\n\\n#### Reviewer Responsibilities\\n\\n[Permalink: Reviewer Responsibilities](#reviewer-responsibilities)\\n\\n- Timely Reviews: Reviewers should strive to review PRs promptly to keep the project moving.\\n- Constructive Feedback: Provide feedback that is clear, constructive, and aimed at helping the contributor improve.\\n- Collaboration: Work with the contributor to address any issues and ensure the final code meets the project‚Äôs standards.\\n- Approvals: Only approve code that you are confident meets all the necessary criteria.\\n\\n#### Common Pitfalls\\n\\n[Permalink: Common Pitfalls](#common-pitfalls)\\n\\n- Large PRs: Avoid submitting PRs that are too large. Break down your changes into smaller, manageable PRs if possible.\\n- Ignoring Feedback: Address all feedback provided by reviewers, even if you don‚Äôt agree with it‚Äîdiscuss it instead of ignoring it.\\n- Rushed Reviews: Avoid rushing through reviews. Taking the time to thoroughly review code is critical to maintaining quality.\\n\\nCode reviews are an essential part of maintaining the quality and integrity of our open source project. By following these guidelines, we can ensure that CAMEL remains robust, secure, and easy to maintain, while also fostering a collaborative and welcoming community.\\n\\n### Guideline for Writing Docstrings\\n\\n[Permalink: Guideline for Writing Docstrings](#guideline-for-writing-docstrings)\\n\\nThis guideline will help you write clear, concise, and structured docstrings for contributing to `CAMEL`.\\n\\n#### 1\\\\. Use the Triple-Quoted String with `r\"\"\"` (Raw String)\\n\\n[Permalink: 1. Use the Triple-Quoted String with r\"\"\" (Raw String)](#1-use-the-triple-quoted-string-with-r-raw-string)\\n\\nBegin the docstring with `r\"\"\"` to indicate a raw docstring. This prevents any issues with special characters and ensures consistent formatting, especially in documentation tools like Sphinx.\\n\\n#### 2\\\\. Provide a Brief Class or Method Description\\n\\n[Permalink: 2. Provide a Brief Class or Method Description](#2-provide-a-brief-class-or-method-description)\\n\\n- Start with a concise summary of the purpose and functionality.\\n- Keep each line under `79` characters.\\n- The summary should start on the first line without a linebreak.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\nr\"\"\"Class for managing conversations of CAMEL Chat Agents.\\n\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n#### 3\\\\. Document Parameters in the Args Section\\n\\n[Permalink: 3. Document Parameters in the Args Section](#3-document-parameters-in-the-args-section)\\n\\n- Use an `Args`: section for documenting constructor or function parameters.\\n- Maintain the `79`-character limit for each line, and indent continuation lines by 4 spaces.\\n- Follow this structure:\\n  - Parameter Name: Match the function signature.\\n  - Type: Include the type (e.g., `int`, `str`, custom types like `BaseModelBackend`).\\n  - Description: Provide a brief explanation of the parameter\\'s role.\\n  - Default Value: Use ( `default: :obj:<default_value>`) to indicate default values.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\nArgs:\\n    system_message (BaseMessage): The system message for initializing\\n        the agent\\'s conversation context.\\n    model (BaseModelBackend, optional): The model backend to use for\\n        response generation. Defaults to :obj:`OpenAIModel` with\\n        `GPT_4O_MINI`. (default: :obj:`OpenAIModel` with `GPT_4O_MINI`)\\n```\\n\\n### Principles üõ°Ô∏è\\n\\n[Permalink: Principles üõ°Ô∏è](#principles-Ô∏è)\\n\\n#### Naming Principle: Avoid Abbreviations in Naming\\n\\n[Permalink: Naming Principle: Avoid Abbreviations in Naming](#naming-principle-avoid-abbreviations-in-naming)\\n\\n- Abbreviations can lead to ambiguity, especially since variable names and code in CAMEL are directly used by agents.\\n- Use clear, descriptive names that convey meaning without requiring additional explanation. This improves both human readability and the agent\\'s ability to interpret the code.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- Bad: msg\\\\_win\\\\_sz\\n- Good: message\\\\_window\\\\_size\\n\\nBy adhering to this principle, we ensure that CAMEL remains accessible and unambiguous for both developers and AI agents.\\n\\n#### Logging Principle: Use `logger` Instead of `print`\\n\\n[Permalink: Logging Principle: Use logger Instead of print](#logging-principle-use-logger-instead-of-print)\\n\\nAvoid using `print` for output. Use Python\\'s `logging` module ( `logger`) to ensure consistent, configurable, and professional logging.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- Bad:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nprint(\"Process started\")\\nprint(f\"User input: {user_input}\")\\n```\\n\\n- Good:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nArgs:\\nlogger.info(\"Process started\")\\nlogger.debug(f\"User input: {user_input}\")\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Board Item Create Workflow üõ†Ô∏è\\n\\n[Permalink: Board Item Create Workflow üõ†Ô∏è](#board-item-create-workflow-Ô∏è)\\n\\nAt CAMEL, we manage our project through a structured workflow that ensures efficiency and clarity in our development process.

The aim is to ensure that all contributions are of high quality, align with the project\\'s goals, and are consistent with our coding standards.\\n\\n#### Purpose of Code Reviews\\n\\n[Permalink: Purpose of Code Reviews](#purpose-of-code-reviews)\\n\\n- Maintain Code Quality: Ensure that the codebase remains clean, readable, and maintainable.\\n- Knowledge Sharing: Facilitate knowledge sharing among contributors and help new contributors learn best practices.\\n- Bug Prevention: Catch potential bugs and issues before they are merged into the main branch.\\n- Consistency: Ensure consistency in style, design patterns, and architecture across the project.\\n\\n#### Review Process Overview\\n\\n[Permalink: Review Process Overview](#review-process-overview)\\n\\n- Reviewers should check the code for functionality, readability, consistency, and compliance with the project‚Äôs coding standards.\\n- If changes are necessary, the reviewer should leave constructive feedback.\\n- The contributor addresses feedback and updates the PR.\\n- The reviewer re-reviews the updated code.\\n- Once the code is approved by at least two reviewer, it can be merged into the main branch.\\n- Merging should be done by a maintainer or an authorized contributor.\\n\\n#### Code Review Checklist\\n\\n[Permalink: Code Review Checklist](#code-review-checklist)\\n\\n- Functionality\\n  - Correctness: Does the code perform the intended task? Are edge cases handled?\\n  - Testing: Is there sufficient test coverage? Do all tests pass?\\n  - Security: Are there any security vulnerabilities introduced by the change?\\n  - Performance: Does the code introduce any performance regressions?\\n- Code Quality\\n  - Readability: Is the code easy to read and understand? Is it well-commented where necessary?\\n  - Maintainability: Is the code structured in a way that makes future changes easy?\\n  - Style: Does the code follow the project‚Äôs style guidelines?\\n    Currently we use Ruff for format check and take Google Python Style Guide as reference.\\n  - Documentation: Are public methods, classes, and any complex logic well-documented?\\n- Design\\n  - Consistency: Does the code follow established design patterns and project architecture?\\n  - Modularity: Are the changes modular and self-contained? Does the code avoid unnecessary duplication?\\n  - Dependencies: Are dependencies minimized and used appropriately?\\n\\n#### Reviewer Responsibilities\\n\\n[Permalink: Reviewer Responsibilities](#reviewer-responsibilities)\\n\\n- Timely Reviews: Reviewers should strive to review PRs promptly to keep the project moving.\\n- Constructive Feedback: Provide feedback that is clear, constructive, and aimed at helping the contributor improve.\\n- Collaboration: Work with the contributor to address any issues and ensure the final code meets the project‚Äôs standards.\\n- Approvals: Only approve code that you are confident meets all the necessary criteria.\\n\\n#### Common Pitfalls\\n\\n[Permalink: Common Pitfalls](#common-pitfalls)\\n\\n- Large PRs: Avoid submitting PRs that are too large. Break down your changes into smaller, manageable PRs if possible.\\n- Ignoring Feedback: Address all feedback provided by reviewers, even if you don‚Äôt agree with it‚Äîdiscuss it instead of ignoring it.\\n- Rushed Reviews: Avoid rushing through reviews. Taking the time to thoroughly review code is critical to maintaining quality.\\n\\nCode reviews are an essential part of maintaining the quality and integrity of our open source project. By following these guidelines, we can ensure that CAMEL remains robust, secure, and easy to maintain, while also fostering a collaborative and welcoming community.\\n\\n### Guideline for Writing Docstrings\\n\\n[Permalink: Guideline for Writing Docstrings](#guideline-for-writing-docstrings)\\n\\nThis guideline will help you write clear, concise, and structured docstrings for contributing to `CAMEL`.\\n\\n#### 1\\\\. Use the Triple-Quoted String with `r\"\"\"` (Raw String)\\n\\n[Permalink: 1. Use the Triple-Quoted String with r\"\"\" (Raw String)](#1-use-the-triple-quoted-string-with-r-raw-string)\\n\\nBegin the docstring with `r\"\"\"` to indicate a raw docstring. This prevents any issues with special characters and ensures consistent formatting, especially in documentation tools like Sphinx.\\n\\n#### 2\\\\. Provide a Brief Class or Method Description\\n\\n[Permalink: 2. Provide a Brief Class or Method Description](#2-provide-a-brief-class-or-method-description)\\n\\n- Start with a concise summary of the purpose and functionality.\\n- Keep each line under `79` characters.\\n- The summary should start on the first line without a linebreak.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\nr\"\"\"Class for managing conversations of CAMEL Chat Agents.\\n\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n#### 3\\\\. Document Parameters in the Args Section\\n\\n[Permalink: 3. Document Parameters in the Args Section](#3-document-parameters-in-the-args-section)\\n\\n- Use an `Args`: section for documenting constructor or function parameters.\\n- Maintain the `79`-character limit for each line, and indent continuation lines by 4 spaces.\\n- Follow this structure:\\n  - Parameter Name: Match the function signature.\\n  - Type: Include the type (e.g., `int`, `str`, custom types like `BaseModelBackend`).\\n  - Description: Provide a brief explanation of the parameter\\'s role.\\n  - Default Value: Use ( `default: :obj:<default_value>`) to indicate default values.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\nArgs:\\n    system_message (BaseMessage): The system message for initializing\\n        the agent\\'s conversation context.\\n    model (BaseModelBackend, optional): The model backend to use for\\n        response generation. Defaults to :obj:`OpenAIModel` with\\n        `GPT_4O_MINI`. (default: :obj:`OpenAIModel` with `GPT_4O_MINI`)\\n```\\n\\n### Principles üõ°Ô∏è\\n\\n[Permalink: Principles üõ°Ô∏è](#principles-Ô∏è)\\n\\n#### Naming Principle: Avoid Abbreviations in Naming\\n\\n[Permalink: Naming Principle: Avoid Abbreviations in Naming](#naming-principle-avoid-abbreviations-in-naming)\\n\\n- Abbreviations can lead to ambiguity, especially since variable names and code in CAMEL are directly used by agents.\\n- Use clear, descriptive names that convey meaning without requiring additional explanation. This improves both human readability and the agent\\'s ability to interpret the code.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- Bad: msg\\\\_win\\\\_sz\\n- Good: message\\\\_window\\\\_size\\n\\nBy adhering to this principle, we ensure that CAMEL remains accessible and unambiguous for both developers and AI agents.\\n\\n#### Logging Principle: Use `logger` Instead of `print`\\n\\n[Permalink: Logging Principle: Use logger Instead of print](#logging-principle-use-logger-instead-of-print)\\n\\nAvoid using `print` for output. Use Python\\'s `logging` module ( `logger`) to ensure consistent, configurable, and professional logging.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- Bad:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nprint(\"Process started\")\\nprint(f\"User input: {user_input}\")\\n```\\n\\n- Good:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nArgs:\\nlogger.info(\"Process started\")\\nlogger.debug(f\"User input: {user_input}\")\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Board Item Create Workflow üõ†Ô∏è\\n\\n[Permalink: Board Item Create Workflow üõ†Ô∏è](#board-item-create-workflow-Ô∏è)\\n\\nAt CAMEL, we manage our project through a structured workflow that ensures efficiency and clarity in our development process.

The aim is to ensure that all contributions are of high quality, align with the project\\'s goals, and are consistent with our coding standards.\\n\\n#### Purpose of Code Reviews\\n\\n[Permalink: Purpose of Code Reviews](#purpose-of-code-reviews)\\n\\n- Maintain Code Quality: Ensure that the codebase remains clean, readable, and maintainable.\\n- Knowledge Sharing: Facilitate knowledge sharing among contributors and help new contributors learn best practices.\\n- Bug Prevention: Catch potential bugs and issues before they are merged into the main branch.\\n- Consistency: Ensure consistency in style, design patterns, and architecture across the project.\\n\\n#### Review Process Overview\\n\\n[Permalink: Review Process Overview](#review-process-overview)\\n\\n- Reviewers should check the code for functionality, readability, consistency, and compliance with the project‚Äôs coding standards.\\n- If changes are necessary, the reviewer should leave constructive feedback.\\n- The contributor addresses feedback and updates the PR.\\n- The reviewer re-reviews the updated code.\\n- Once the code is approved by at least two reviewer, it can be merged into the main branch.\\n- Merging should be done by a maintainer or an authorized contributor.\\n\\n#### Code Review Checklist\\n\\n[Permalink: Code Review Checklist](#code-review-checklist)\\n\\n- Functionality\\n  - Correctness: Does the code perform the intended task? Are edge cases handled?\\n  - Testing: Is there sufficient test coverage? Do all tests pass?\\n  - Security: Are there any security vulnerabilities introduced by the change?\\n  - Performance: Does the code introduce any performance regressions?\\n- Code Quality\\n  - Readability: Is the code easy to read and understand? Is it well-commented where necessary?\\n  - Maintainability: Is the code structured in a way that makes future changes easy?\\n  - Style: Does the code follow the project‚Äôs style guidelines?\\n    Currently we use Ruff for format check and take Google Python Style Guide as reference.\\n  - Documentation: Are public methods, classes, and any complex logic well-documented?\\n- Design\\n  - Consistency: Does the code follow established design patterns and project architecture?\\n  - Modularity: Are the changes modular and self-contained? Does the code avoid unnecessary duplication?\\n  - Dependencies: Are dependencies minimized and used appropriately?\\n\\n#### Reviewer Responsibilities\\n\\n[Permalink: Reviewer Responsibilities](#reviewer-responsibilities)\\n\\n- Timely Reviews: Reviewers should strive to review PRs promptly to keep the project moving.\\n- Constructive Feedback: Provide feedback that is clear, constructive, and aimed at helping the contributor improve.\\n- Collaboration: Work with the contributor to address any issues and ensure the final code meets the project‚Äôs standards.\\n- Approvals: Only approve code that you are confident meets all the necessary criteria.\\n\\n#### Common Pitfalls\\n\\n[Permalink: Common Pitfalls](#common-pitfalls)\\n\\n- Large PRs: Avoid submitting PRs that are too large. Break down your changes into smaller, manageable PRs if possible.\\n- Ignoring Feedback: Address all feedback provided by reviewers, even if you don‚Äôt agree with it‚Äîdiscuss it instead of ignoring it.\\n- Rushed Reviews: Avoid rushing through reviews. Taking the time to thoroughly review code is critical to maintaining quality.\\n\\nCode reviews are an essential part of maintaining the quality and integrity of our open source project. By following these guidelines, we can ensure that CAMEL remains robust, secure, and easy to maintain, while also fostering a collaborative and welcoming community.\\n\\n### Guideline for Writing Docstrings\\n\\n[Permalink: Guideline for Writing Docstrings](#guideline-for-writing-docstrings)\\n\\nThis guideline will help you write clear, concise, and structured docstrings for contributing to `CAMEL`.\\n\\n#### 1\\\\. Use the Triple-Quoted String with `r\"\"\"` (Raw String)\\n\\n[Permalink: 1. Use the Triple-Quoted String with r\"\"\" (Raw String)](#1-use-the-triple-quoted-string-with-r-raw-string)\\n\\nBegin the docstring with `r\"\"\"` to indicate a raw docstring. This prevents any issues with special characters and ensures consistent formatting, especially in documentation tools like Sphinx.\\n\\n#### 2\\\\. Provide a Brief Class or Method Description\\n\\n[Permalink: 2. Provide a Brief Class or Method Description](#2-provide-a-brief-class-or-method-description)\\n\\n- Start with a concise summary of the purpose and functionality.\\n- Keep each line under `79` characters.\\n- The summary should start on the first line without a linebreak.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\nr\"\"\"Class for managing conversations of CAMEL Chat Agents.\\n\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n#### 3\\\\. Document Parameters in the Args Section\\n\\n[Permalink: 3. Document Parameters in the Args Section](#3-document-parameters-in-the-args-section)\\n\\n- Use an `Args`: section for documenting constructor or function parameters.\\n- Maintain the `79`-character limit for each line, and indent continuation lines by 4 spaces.\\n- Follow this structure:\\n  - Parameter Name: Match the function signature.\\n  - Type: Include the type (e.g., `int`, `str`, custom types like `BaseModelBackend`).\\n  - Description: Provide a brief explanation of the parameter\\'s role.\\n  - Default Value: Use ( `default: :obj:<default_value>`) to indicate default values.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\nArgs:\\n    system_message (BaseMessage): The system message for initializing\\n        the agent\\'s conversation context.\\n    model (BaseModelBackend, optional): The model backend to use for\\n        response generation. Defaults to :obj:`OpenAIModel` with\\n        `GPT_4O_MINI`. (default: :obj:`OpenAIModel` with `GPT_4O_MINI`)\\n```\\n\\n### Principles üõ°Ô∏è\\n\\n[Permalink: Principles üõ°Ô∏è](#principles-Ô∏è)\\n\\n#### Naming Principle: Avoid Abbreviations in Naming\\n\\n[Permalink: Naming Principle: Avoid Abbreviations in Naming](#naming-principle-avoid-abbreviations-in-naming)\\n\\n- Abbreviations can lead to ambiguity, especially since variable names and code in CAMEL are directly used by agents.\\n- Use clear, descriptive names that convey meaning without requiring additional explanation. This improves both human readability and the agent\\'s ability to interpret the code.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- Bad: msg\\\\_win\\\\_sz\\n- Good: message\\\\_window\\\\_size\\n\\nBy adhering to this principle, we ensure that CAMEL remains accessible and unambiguous for both developers and AI agents.\\n\\n#### Logging Principle: Use `logger` Instead of `print`\\n\\n[Permalink: Logging Principle: Use logger Instead of print](#logging-principle-use-logger-instead-of-print)\\n\\nAvoid using `print` for output. Use Python\\'s `logging` module ( `logger`) to ensure consistent, configurable, and professional logging.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- Bad:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nprint(\"Process started\")\\nprint(f\"User input: {user_input}\")\\n```\\n\\n- Good:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nArgs:\\nlogger.info(\"Process started\")\\nlogger.debug(f\"User input: {user_input}\")\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Board Item Create Workflow üõ†Ô∏è\\n\\n[Permalink: Board Item Create Workflow üõ†Ô∏è](#board-item-create-workflow-Ô∏è)\\n\\nAt CAMEL, we manage our project through a structured workflow that ensures efficiency and clarity in our development process. Our workflow includes stages for issue creation and pull requests (PRs), sprint planning, and reviews.\\n\\n#### Issue Item Stage:\\n\\n[Permalink: Issue Item Stage:](#issue-item-stage)\\n\\nOur [issues](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/issues) page on GitHub is regularly updated with bugs, improvements, and feature requests. We have a handy set of labels to help you sort through and find issues that interest you. Feel free to use these labels to keep things organized.\\n\\nWhen you start working on an issue, please assign it to yourself so that others know it\\'s being taken care of.\\n\\nWhen creating a new issue, it\\'s best to keep it focused on a specific bug, improvement, or feature. If two issues are related or blocking each other, it\\'s better to link them instead of merging them into one.\\n\\nWe do our best to keep these issues up to date, but considering the fast-paced nature of this field, some may become outdated. If you come across any such issues, please give us a heads-up so we can address them promptly. üëÄ\\n\\nHere‚Äôs how to engage with our issues effectively:\\n\\n- Go to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/issues), create a new issue, choose the category, and fill in the required information.\\n- Ensure the issue has a proper title and update the Assignees, Labels, Projects (select Backlog status), Development, and Milestones.\\n- Discuss the issue during team meetings, then move it to the Analysis Done column.\\n- At the beginning of each sprint, share the analyzed issue and move it to the Sprint Planned column if you are going to work on this issue in the sprint.\\n\\n#### Pull Request Item Stage:\\n\\n[Permalink: Pull Request Item Stage:](#pull-request-item-stage)\\n\\n- Go to [GitHub Pulls](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel/pulls), create a new PR, choose the branch, and fill in the information, linking the related issue.\\n- Ensure the PR has a proper title and update the Reviewers (convert to draft), Assignees, Labels, Projects (select Developing status), Development, and Milestones.\\n- If the PR is related to a roadmap, link the roadmap to the PR.\\n- Move the PR item through the stages: Developing, Stuck, Reviewing (click ready for review), Merged. The linked issue will close automatically when the PR is merged.\\n\\n**Labeling PRs:**\\n\\n- **feat**: For new features (e.g., `feat: Add new AI model`)\\n- **fix**: For bug fixes (e.g., `fix: Resolve memory leak issue`)\\n- **docs**: For documentation updates (e.g., `docs: Update contribution guidelines`)\\n- **style**: For code style changes (e.g., `style: Refactor code formatting`)\\n- **refactor**: For code refactoring (e.g., `refactor: Optimize data processing`)\\n- **test**: For adding or updating tests (e.g., `test: Add unit tests for new feature`)\\n- **chore**: For maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore: Update dependencies`)\\n\\n### Sprint Planning & Review üéØ\\n\\n[Permalink: Sprint Planning & Review üéØ](#sprint-planning--review-)\\n\\n#### Definition\\n\\n[Permalink: Definition](#definition)\\n\\nSprint planning defines what can be delivered in the sprint and how it will be achieved. Sprint review allows stakeholders to review and provide feedback on recent work.\\n\\n#### Practice\\n\\n[Permalink: Practice](#practice)\\n\\n- **Sprint Duration**: Two weeks for development, one week for review.\\n- **Sprint Planning & Review**: Conducted biweekly during the dev meeting (around 30 minutes).\\n- **Planning**: Founder highlights the sprint goal and key points; developers pick items for the sprint.\\n- **Review**: Feedback on delivered features and identification of improvement areas.\\n\\n### Getting Help üÜò\\n\\n[Permalink: Getting Help üÜò](#getting-help-)\\n\\nOur aim is to make the developer setup as straightforward as possible. If you encounter any challenges during the setup process, don\\'t hesitate to reach out to a maintainer. We\\'re here to assist you and ensure that the experience is smooth not just for you but also for future contributors. üòä\\n\\nIn line with this, we do have specific guidelines for code linting, formatting, and documentation in the codebase. If you find these requirements difficult or even just bothersome to work with, please feel free to get in touch with a maintainer. We don\\'t want these guidelines to hinder the integration of good code into the codebase, so we\\'re more than happy to provide support and find a solution that works for you. ü§ù\\n\\n## Quick Start üöÄ\\n\\n[Permalink: Quick Start üöÄ](#quick-start-)\\n\\nTo get started with CAMEL, follow these steps:\\n\\n```\\n# Clone github repo\\ngit clone https://github.com/camel-ai/camel.git\\n\\n# Change directory into project directory\\ncd camel\\n\\n# Activate camel virtual environment\\npoetry shell\\n\\n# Install camel from source\\npoetry install --with dev,docs -E all  # (Suggested for developers, needed to pass all tests)\\n\\n# The following command installs a pre-commit hook into the local git repo,\\n# so every commit gets auto-formatted and linted.\\npre-commit install\\n\\n# Run camel\\'s pre-commit before push\\npre-commit run --all-files\\n\\n# Run camel\\'s unit tests\\npytest test\\n\\n# Exit the virtual environment\\nexit\\n```\\n\\nThese commands will install all the necessary dependencies for running the package, examples, linting, formatting, tests, and coverage.\\n\\nTo verify that everything is set up correctly, run `pytest .` This will ensure that all tests pass successfully. ‚úÖ\\n\\nTip\\n\\nYou need to config different API Keys as environment variables to pass all tests.\\n\\n## Common Actions üîÑ\\n\\n[Permalink: Common Actions üîÑ](#common-actions-)\\n\\n### Update dependencies\\n\\n[Permalink: Update dependencies](#update-dependencies)\\n\\nWhenever you add, update, or delete any dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, please run `poetry lock` to synchronize the dependencies with the lock file.\\n\\n### Linting & Formatting ‚ú®\\n\\n[Permalink: Linting & Formatting ‚ú®](#linting--formatting-)\\n\\n```\\npoetry run ruff check .\\npoetry run ruff format .\\n```\\n\\nFor extra validation of type hints:\\n\\n```\\nmypy --namespace-packages -p camel\\nmypy --namespace-packages -p test\\nmypy --namespace-packages -p examples\\nmypy --namespace-packages -p apps\\n```\\n\\n### Coverage üìä\\n\\n[Permalink: Coverage üìä](#coverage-)\\n\\nCode coverage measures the extent to which unit tests cover the code, helping identify both robust and less robust areas of the codebase.\\n\\nTo generate a report showing the current code coverage, execute one of the following commands.\\n\\nTo include all source files into coverage:\\n\\n```\\ncoverage erase\\ncoverage run --source=. -m pytest .\\ncoverage html\\n# Open htmlcov/index.html\\n```\\n\\nTo include only tested files:\\n\\n```\\npytest --cov --cov-report=html\\n```\\n\\nThe coverage report will be generated at `htmlcov/index.html`.\\n\\n### Tests üß™\\n\\n[Permalink: Tests üß™](#tests-)\\n\\nUnit tests cover modular logic that doesn\\'t require calls to outside APIs.

The aim is to ensure that all contributions are of high quality, align with the project\\'s goals, and are consistent with our coding standards.\\n\\n#### Purpose of Code Reviews\\n\\n[Permalink: Purpose of Code Reviews](#purpose-of-code-reviews)\\n\\n- Maintain Code Quality: Ensure that the codebase remains clean, readable, and maintainable.\\n- Knowledge Sharing: Facilitate knowledge sharing among contributors and help new contributors learn best practices.\\n- Bug Prevention: Catch potential bugs and issues before they are merged into the main branch.\\n- Consistency: Ensure consistency in style, design patterns, and architecture across the project.\\n\\n#### Review Process Overview\\n\\n[Permalink: Review Process Overview](#review-process-overview)\\n\\n- Reviewers should check the code for functionality, readability, consistency, and compliance with the project‚Äôs coding standards.\\n- If changes are necessary, the reviewer should leave constructive feedback.\\n- The contributor addresses feedback and updates the PR.\\n- The reviewer re-reviews the updated code.\\n- Once the code is approved by at least two reviewer, it can be merged into the main branch.\\n- Merging should be done by a maintainer or an authorized contributor.\\n\\n#### Code Review Checklist\\n\\n[Permalink: Code Review Checklist](#code-review-checklist)\\n\\n- Functionality\\n  - Correctness: Does the code perform the intended task? Are edge cases handled?\\n  - Testing: Is there sufficient test coverage? Do all tests pass?\\n  - Security: Are there any security vulnerabilities introduced by the change?\\n  - Performance: Does the code introduce any performance regressions?\\n- Code Quality\\n  - Readability: Is the code easy to read and understand? Is it well-commented where necessary?\\n  - Maintainability: Is the code structured in a way that makes future changes easy?\\n  - Style: Does the code follow the project‚Äôs style guidelines?\\n    Currently we use Ruff for format check and take Google Python Style Guide as reference.\\n  - Documentation: Are public methods, classes, and any complex logic well-documented?\\n- Design\\n  - Consistency: Does the code follow established design patterns and project architecture?\\n  - Modularity: Are the changes modular and self-contained? Does the code avoid unnecessary duplication?\\n  - Dependencies: Are dependencies minimized and used appropriately?\\n\\n#### Reviewer Responsibilities\\n\\n[Permalink: Reviewer Responsibilities](#reviewer-responsibilities)\\n\\n- Timely Reviews: Reviewers should strive to review PRs promptly to keep the project moving.\\n- Constructive Feedback: Provide feedback that is clear, constructive, and aimed at helping the contributor improve.\\n- Collaboration: Work with the contributor to address any issues and ensure the final code meets the project‚Äôs standards.\\n- Approvals: Only approve code that you are confident meets all the necessary criteria.\\n\\n#### Common Pitfalls\\n\\n[Permalink: Common Pitfalls](#common-pitfalls)\\n\\n- Large PRs: Avoid submitting PRs that are too large. Break down your changes into smaller, manageable PRs if possible.\\n- Ignoring Feedback: Address all feedback provided by reviewers, even if you don‚Äôt agree with it‚Äîdiscuss it instead of ignoring it.\\n- Rushed Reviews: Avoid rushing through reviews. Taking the time to thoroughly review code is critical to maintaining quality.\\n\\nCode reviews are an essential part of maintaining the quality and integrity of our open source project. By following these guidelines, we can ensure that CAMEL remains robust, secure, and easy to maintain, while also fostering a collaborative and welcoming community.\\n\\n### Guideline for Writing Docstrings\\n\\n[Permalink: Guideline for Writing Docstrings](#guideline-for-writing-docstrings)\\n\\nThis guideline will help you write clear, concise, and structured docstrings for contributing to `CAMEL`.\\n\\n#### 1\\\\. Use the Triple-Quoted String with `r\"\"\"` (Raw String)\\n\\n[Permalink: 1. Use the Triple-Quoted String with r\"\"\" (Raw String)](#1-use-the-triple-quoted-string-with-r-raw-string)\\n\\nBegin the docstring with `r\"\"\"` to indicate a raw docstring. This prevents any issues with special characters and ensures consistent formatting, especially in documentation tools like Sphinx.\\n\\n#### 2\\\\. Provide a Brief Class or Method Description\\n\\n[Permalink: 2. Provide a Brief Class or Method Description](#2-provide-a-brief-class-or-method-description)\\n\\n- Start with a concise summary of the purpose and functionality.\\n- Keep each line under `79` characters.\\n- The summary should start on the first line without a linebreak.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\nr\"\"\"Class for managing conversations of CAMEL Chat Agents.\\n\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n#### 3\\\\. Document Parameters in the Args Section\\n\\n[Permalink: 3. Document Parameters in the Args Section](#3-document-parameters-in-the-args-section)\\n\\n- Use an `Args`: section for documenting constructor or function parameters.\\n- Maintain the `79`-character limit for each line, and indent continuation lines by 4 spaces.\\n- Follow this structure:\\n  - Parameter Name: Match the function signature.\\n  - Type: Include the type (e.g., `int`, `str`, custom types like `BaseModelBackend`).\\n  - Description: Provide a brief explanation of the parameter\\'s role.\\n  - Default Value: Use ( `default: :obj:<default_value>`) to indicate default values.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\nArgs:\\n    system_message (BaseMessage): The system message for initializing\\n        the agent\\'s conversation context.\\n    model (BaseModelBackend, optional): The model backend to use for\\n        response generation. Defaults to :obj:`OpenAIModel` with\\n        `GPT_4O_MINI`. (default: :obj:`OpenAIModel` with `GPT_4O_MINI`)\\n```\\n\\n### Principles üõ°Ô∏è\\n\\n[Permalink: Principles üõ°Ô∏è](#principles-Ô∏è)\\n\\n#### Naming Principle: Avoid Abbreviations in Naming\\n\\n[Permalink: Naming Principle: Avoid Abbreviations in Naming](#naming-principle-avoid-abbreviations-in-naming)\\n\\n- Abbreviations can lead to ambiguity, especially since variable names and code in CAMEL are directly used by agents.\\n- Use clear, descriptive names that convey meaning without requiring additional explanation. This improves both human readability and the agent\\'s ability to interpret the code.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- Bad: msg\\\\_win\\\\_sz\\n- Good: message\\\\_window\\\\_size\\n\\nBy adhering to this principle, we ensure that CAMEL remains accessible and unambiguous for both developers and AI agents.\\n\\n#### Logging Principle: Use `logger` Instead of `print`\\n\\n[Permalink: Logging Principle: Use logger Instead of print](#logging-principle-use-logger-instead-of-print)\\n\\nAvoid using `print` for output. Use Python\\'s `logging` module ( `logger`) to ensure consistent, configurable, and professional logging.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- Bad:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nprint(\"Process started\")\\nprint(f\"User input: {user_input}\")\\n```\\n\\n- Good:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nArgs:\\nlogger.info(\"Process started\")\\nlogger.debug(f\"User input: {user_input}\")\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Board Item Create Workflow üõ†Ô∏è\\n\\n[Permalink: Board Item Create Workflow üõ†Ô∏è](#board-item-create-workflow-Ô∏è)\\n\\nAt CAMEL, we manage our project through a structured workflow that ensures efficiency and clarity in our development process.

The aim is to ensure that all contributions are of high quality, align with the project\\'s goals, and are consistent with our coding standards.\\n\\n#### Purpose of Code Reviews\\n\\n[Permalink: Purpose of Code Reviews](#purpose-of-code-reviews)\\n\\n- Maintain Code Quality: Ensure that the codebase remains clean, readable, and maintainable.\\n- Knowledge Sharing: Facilitate knowledge sharing among contributors and help new contributors learn best practices.\\n- Bug Prevention: Catch potential bugs and issues before they are merged into the main branch.\\n- Consistency: Ensure consistency in style, design patterns, and architecture across the project.\\n\\n#### Review Process Overview\\n\\n[Permalink: Review Process Overview](#review-process-overview)\\n\\n- Reviewers should check the code for functionality, readability, consistency, and compliance with the project‚Äôs coding standards.\\n- If changes are necessary, the reviewer should leave constructive feedback.\\n- The contributor addresses feedback and updates the PR.\\n- The reviewer re-reviews the updated code.\\n- Once the code is approved by at least two reviewer, it can be merged into the main branch.\\n- Merging should be done by a maintainer or an authorized contributor.\\n\\n#### Code Review Checklist\\n\\n[Permalink: Code Review Checklist](#code-review-checklist)\\n\\n- Functionality\\n  - Correctness: Does the code perform the intended task? Are edge cases handled?\\n  - Testing: Is there sufficient test coverage? Do all tests pass?\\n  - Security: Are there any security vulnerabilities introduced by the change?\\n  - Performance: Does the code introduce any performance regressions?\\n- Code Quality\\n  - Readability: Is the code easy to read and understand? Is it well-commented where necessary?\\n  - Maintainability: Is the code structured in a way that makes future changes easy?\\n  - Style: Does the code follow the project‚Äôs style guidelines?\\n    Currently we use Ruff for format check and take Google Python Style Guide as reference.\\n  - Documentation: Are public methods, classes, and any complex logic well-documented?\\n- Design\\n  - Consistency: Does the code follow established design patterns and project architecture?\\n  - Modularity: Are the changes modular and self-contained? Does the code avoid unnecessary duplication?\\n  - Dependencies: Are dependencies minimized and used appropriately?\\n\\n#### Reviewer Responsibilities\\n\\n[Permalink: Reviewer Responsibilities](#reviewer-responsibilities)\\n\\n- Timely Reviews: Reviewers should strive to review PRs promptly to keep the project moving.\\n- Constructive Feedback: Provide feedback that is clear, constructive, and aimed at helping the contributor improve.\\n- Collaboration: Work with the contributor to address any issues and ensure the final code meets the project‚Äôs standards.\\n- Approvals: Only approve code that you are confident meets all the necessary criteria.\\n\\n#### Common Pitfalls\\n\\n[Permalink: Common Pitfalls](#common-pitfalls)\\n\\n- Large PRs: Avoid submitting PRs that are too large. Break down your changes into smaller, manageable PRs if possible.\\n- Ignoring Feedback: Address all feedback provided by reviewers, even if you don‚Äôt agree with it‚Äîdiscuss it instead of ignoring it.\\n- Rushed Reviews: Avoid rushing through reviews. Taking the time to thoroughly review code is critical to maintaining quality.\\n\\nCode reviews are an essential part of maintaining the quality and integrity of our open source project. By following these guidelines, we can ensure that CAMEL remains robust, secure, and easy to maintain, while also fostering a collaborative and welcoming community.\\n\\n### Guideline for Writing Docstrings\\n\\n[Permalink: Guideline for Writing Docstrings](#guideline-for-writing-docstrings)\\n\\nThis guideline will help you write clear, concise, and structured docstrings for contributing to `CAMEL`.\\n\\n#### 1\\\\. Use the Triple-Quoted String with `r\"\"\"` (Raw String)\\n\\n[Permalink: 1. Use the Triple-Quoted String with r\"\"\" (Raw String)](#1-use-the-triple-quoted-string-with-r-raw-string)\\n\\nBegin the docstring with `r\"\"\"` to indicate a raw docstring. This prevents any issues with special characters and ensures consistent formatting, especially in documentation tools like Sphinx.\\n\\n#### 2\\\\. Provide a Brief Class or Method Description\\n\\n[Permalink: 2. Provide a Brief Class or Method Description](#2-provide-a-brief-class-or-method-description)\\n\\n- Start with a concise summary of the purpose and functionality.\\n- Keep each line under `79` characters.\\n- The summary should start on the first line without a linebreak.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\nr\"\"\"Class for managing conversations of CAMEL Chat Agents.\\n\"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n#### 3\\\\. Document Parameters in the Args Section\\n\\n[Permalink: 3. Document Parameters in the Args Section](#3-document-parameters-in-the-args-section)\\n\\n- Use an `Args`: section for documenting constructor or function parameters.\\n- Maintain the `79`-character limit for each line, and indent continuation lines by 4 spaces.\\n- Follow this structure:\\n  - Parameter Name: Match the function signature.\\n  - Type: Include the type (e.g., `int`, `str`, custom types like `BaseModelBackend`).\\n  - Description: Provide a brief explanation of the parameter\\'s role.\\n  - Default Value: Use ( `default: :obj:<default_value>`) to indicate default values.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n```\\nArgs:\\n    system_message (BaseMessage): The system message for initializing\\n        the agent\\'s conversation context.\\n    model (BaseModelBackend, optional): The model backend to use for\\n        response generation. Defaults to :obj:`OpenAIModel` with\\n        `GPT_4O_MINI`. (default: :obj:`OpenAIModel` with `GPT_4O_MINI`)\\n```\\n\\n### Principles üõ°Ô∏è\\n\\n[Permalink: Principles üõ°Ô∏è](#principles-Ô∏è)\\n\\n#### Naming Principle: Avoid Abbreviations in Naming\\n\\n[Permalink: Naming Principle: Avoid Abbreviations in Naming](#naming-principle-avoid-abbreviations-in-naming)\\n\\n- Abbreviations can lead to ambiguity, especially since variable names and code in CAMEL are directly used by agents.\\n- Use clear, descriptive names that convey meaning without requiring additional explanation. This improves both human readability and the agent\\'s ability to interpret the code.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- Bad: msg\\\\_win\\\\_sz\\n- Good: message\\\\_window\\\\_size\\n\\nBy adhering to this principle, we ensure that CAMEL remains accessible and unambiguous for both developers and AI agents.\\n\\n#### Logging Principle: Use `logger` Instead of `print`\\n\\n[Permalink: Logging Principle: Use logger Instead of print](#logging-principle-use-logger-instead-of-print)\\n\\nAvoid using `print` for output. Use Python\\'s `logging` module ( `logger`) to ensure consistent, configurable, and professional logging.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- Bad:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nprint(\"Process started\")\\nprint(f\"User input: {user_input}\")\\n```\\n\\n- Good:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nArgs:\\nlogger.info(\"Process started\")\\nlogger.debug(f\"User input: {user_input}\")\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Board Item Create Workflow üõ†Ô∏è\\n\\n[Permalink: Board Item Create Workflow üõ†Ô∏è](#board-item-create-workflow-Ô∏è)\\n\\nAt CAMEL, we manage our project through a structured workflow that ensures efficiency and clarity in our development process.
